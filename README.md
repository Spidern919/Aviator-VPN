## Customization

### Adding New Prediction Algorithms
1. Open `script.js`
2. Add your algorithm function in the `generatePredictionMultiplier()` function
3. Update the settings dropdown in `index.html`

### Styling Customization
1. Modify `styles.css` to change colors, fonts, and layout
2. The application uses CSS custom properties for easy theming
3. Responsive breakpoints are clearly defined

### Data Structure
The application uses a virtual database system with enhanced data structures:
- **Clients**: `{id, name, phone, country, subscription, code, status, createdDate, receiptUploaded, receiptName}`
- **Predictions**: `{id, multiplier, status, result, timestamp, createdAt, updatedAt}`
- **Settings**: `{algorithm, updateFrequency, successThreshold, updatedAt}`
- **Connections**: `{clientId: {connected, timestamp, updatedAt}}`
- **Logs**: `{timestamp, level, message}`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Data Not Loading**
   - Check the Database Management section for available backups
   - Use the "Restore Backup" function if needed
   - Clear browser localStorage as last resort
   - Refresh the page
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **Predictions Not Updating**
   - Check the update frequency setting
   - Ensure the page is active (not minimized)
   - Verify browser allows JavaScript execution

3. **Client Code Not Working**
   - Ensure the client is marked as 'active'
   - Check for typos in the client code
   - Verify the client exists in the system

### Performance Tips

- Close unused browser tabs
- Clear browser cache periodically
- Use a modern browser for best performance
- Keep the application tab active for real-time updates
